With the rising significance of digitalisation, industry 4.0 and the corresponding work field of autonomous robots, the knowledge and experience of developing and implementing software for these autonomous robots has reached a new peak of importance. The students from the master program "Informationssysteme" of the University of Applied Sciences Ulm participated at the RoboCup German Open since 2010. This year was the second participation in the RoboCup Logistics League. The requirements for a modern industry factory are covered by the RoboCup Logistics League competition where robots have to fulfill tasks and interact with other robots and their environment autonomously. This technical report provides insights of the current state of the project and describes the components that have been used and modified during the last two semesters by the students of the master course. The report helps new members to get an overview of the project, components and software.
