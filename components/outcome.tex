\section{Ideas for 2018}

The Robocup team 2017 has many ideas to improve the Robocup project for the next team.\\

The first idea is that the exploration of the field should be more efficient. In 2017, some fixed zones were explored. A first improvement can be to choose the nearest MPS station to approach. To realize this solution, all MPS stations already explored should be stored. A distributed database of detected stations can be a good solution even with multiple Robotinos. To recognize the tag, a perfect docking should be working. In the last version, some imperfections were problematic. Another solution can be to use a smart agent which explores the field. The solution should be able to find each MPS of the team in the limited time.\\

The second point is to use the three Robotinos in the field. Indeed, in 2017 only one robot was used. A multi-deployment is needed for this. A logic should be designed to interact with all these robots. The latest idea was to use one robot as a master and two robots as slaves. A better solution can be to have a peer to peer implementation. Each robot can be a smart agent and communicates with the others.\\

Another idea was to test more the deployment before the contest. It is necessary to drive around with robots and operate in the laboratory before the competition. The problem is that the field in the laboratory is smaller than the real field in the competition. To face this, the Gazebo simulator should be used. With the simulator, a real situation can be tested. A previous implementation was done by the 2016 team. This approach is available in the git repository.\\

An idea to have a better code can be to implement more using SmartTCL. To do this, a lot of effort should be put in the lisp language. One or two persons in the team need to know very well this language. \\

An important missing part during the contest was the production phase. Only the exploration phase was implemented in 2017. That's why the next task is to improve the exploration phase and to begin the production phase. It is important to be prepared for the future changes. Indeed, the contest becomes harder every year, so a good idea can be to imagine the next modification in the rules.\\
