This chapter gives an overview on the current states of the particular components. The Refbox component and the SmartAlvarTagDetection component will be just recapped shortly, because just minimal changes were made.
The new components SmartRobotinoDetection, SmartRobotinoMPSDocking, SmartRobotinoInstructionPlanner and a new LispServer implementation are explained in detail in this chapter.
