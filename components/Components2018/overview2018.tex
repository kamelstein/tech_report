This chapter gives an overview on the current states of the particular components. The \textit{Refbox} component and the \textit{SmartAlvarTagDetection} component will be just recapped shortly, because just minimal changes were made.
The new components \textit{SmartRobotinoDetection}, \textit{SmartRobotinoMPSDocking}, \textit{SmartRobotinoInstructionPlanner} and a new implementation of the sequence of tasks in the \textit{LispServer} are explained in detail in this chapter.
