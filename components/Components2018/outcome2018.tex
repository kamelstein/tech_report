\section{Ideas for 2019}

The RoboCup team 2018 has many ideas for further improvements of the software.\\

To achieve more points, the Production Phase is needed. Therefore the new team should definitely start with the third phase. This phase should also be implemented via the Sequencer. \\

The first feature-complete version of the Exploration Phase is completed and implemented in the Sequencer. Many optimizations are possible here:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimize docking for the Exploration Phase: should be faster, and maybe not even necessary for the ALVAR tag detection and the calculation of the orientation of the MPS machine
\item Optimize detection: the 360 degree turn could be faster and the correct setup for the exclusion of the boundaries need a very precise measurement of the field dimensions. Maybe optimize the detection algorithm itself and exclude corners of the field, robots in the field, etc.
\item Exploration Phase with three robots will be needed to gain the speed that is needed to detect all MPS within the given Time.
\item Optimal path for robots during the Exploration Phase. Algorithm to explore the complete field in a fast and efficient way.
\end{itemize}
