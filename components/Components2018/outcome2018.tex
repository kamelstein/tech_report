\section{Ideas for 2019}

The Robocup team 2018 has many ideas to improve the Robocup project for the next team.\\

To achieve more points, the Production Phase is needed. Therefor the new team should definitely start with the third phase. This phase should also implemented in the Sequencer. \\

The first real version of the Exploration Phase is finished and implemented in the Sequencer. Many optimizations are possible here:
\begin{itemize}
\item optimize docking for the Exploration Phase: should be faster, and maybe not even necessary for the ALVAR tag detection and the calculation of the orientation of the MPS machine
\item optimize detection: the 360 degree could be faster and the exclusion of the borders of the field is not as clean as it could be. Maybe optimize the detection algorithm and exclude corners of the field, robots in the field, etc.
\item Exploration Phase with three robots will be needed to gain the speed that is needed to detect all MPS within the given Time.
\item optimal path for robots during the Exploration Phase. Algorithm or agent, to roam the field in a accurate but fast way.
\end{itemize}
